 * chain. Writing them out here rather than reaching for Android's own `android.media.audiofx
 * .Equalizer` is deliberate: that one is implemented by the device's audio HAL, so its band count,
 * its centres and its response all vary by handset, and a curve dialled in on one phone would not
 * transfer to another — let alone to the desktop build or to an AutoEq profile.
 *
 * Follows the shape [SleepFadeAudioProcessor] established:
 * - the curve is read fresh on every buffer rather than captured, so an adjustment made while
 *   music is playing is audible immediately;
 * - one instance per player, since an [AudioProcessor] carries per-stream state, and they all read
 *   the same supplier so a single write covers both players of a crossfade;
 * - PCM 16-bit only, matching the rest of the chain and what the YouTube sources decode to.
