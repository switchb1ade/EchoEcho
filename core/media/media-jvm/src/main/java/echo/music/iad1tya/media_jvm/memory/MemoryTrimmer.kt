/**
 * Hands memory the allocator is still holding back to the operating system.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 * The desktop app's resident size is dominated by NATIVE memory, not by the Java heap. Measured on
 * Linux with `-Xmx512m` in force: RSS 1.9 GB while the JVM heap was using only 121 MB — the other
 * ~1.3 GB sat in the C allocator. Crucially it was NOT a leak: mpv/FFmpeg allocate and free large
 * demuxer/decoder buffers on every track, and the allocator simply keeps the freed pages instead of
 * returning them. `malloc_trim(0)` on a live process gave back 167 MB instantly (RSS 920 → 753 MB),
 * which is what proves the memory was already free.
 *
 * Every desktop allocator has this behaviour and every one of them exposes a way to ask for the
 * pages back — only the spelling differs:
 *
 * | OS      | call                                                  | since        |
 * |---------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
 * | Linux   | `malloc_trim(0)`                                       | glibc        |
 * | Windows | `HeapSetInformation(NULL, HeapOptimizeResources, ...)` | Windows 8.1  |
 *
 * ## Why macOS is deliberately excluded
 * macOS has an equivalent — `malloc_zone_pressure_relief(NULL, 0)` — and it was wired up here until
 * it was traced to a startup crash. A null zone means EVERY registered zone, not just the one
 * mpv/FFmpeg allocate from, so the call also tells the zones behind Metal, QuartzCore and Skia to
 * hand their free pages back. Dispatched off a background thread it can land in the middle of a
 * `CATransaction` commit on the main thread, and the process dies with an uncaught NSException
 * raised inside `-[MTLLayer blitCallback]`.
 *
 * The race window is narrow enough that anything perturbing timing hides it — attaching
 * `log stream` was enough to make it disappear — so it only reproduced on a real Finder/Dock launch,
 * where activation and the window animation keep the main thread inside CoreAnimation for longer.
 *
 * Nothing is lost by skipping it: `MallocNanoZone=0` in the app's `LSEnvironment` already addresses
 * the allocator growth this class exists to fight on macOS.
 *
 * ## Why it must only run while idle
 * `malloc_trim` walks the heap holding the arena lock, so every thread that calls `malloc` blocks
 * until it finishes — including mpv's decoder threads. Running it during playback is audible.
 * [trim] is therefore called from the paused/idle transitions only, and [MIN_INTERVAL_MS] keeps a
 * burst of state changes from turning into a burst of heap walks.
 *
 * Failures are swallowed on purpose: a missing symbol (Windows older than 8.1, a non-glibc libc
 * such as musl) means "this platform cannot give the pages back", which is a normal outcome, not an
 * error worth surfacing to the user.
