/**
 * JNA binding for libmpv's C client API (`mpv/client.h`).
 *
 * ## Bound against libmpv 0.37.0 / client API 2.2
 * Every signature, enum value and struct layout in this file was read literally off
 * `/usr/include/mpv/client.h` as shipped by Ubuntu `libmpv-dev 0.37.0-1ubuntu4`
 * (`MPV_CLIENT_API_VERSION == MPV_MAKE_VERSION(2, 2)`, runtime `libmpv.so.2.2.0`), and every
 * imported symbol was confirmed present in that binary's dynamic symbol table.
 *
 * **If the bundled/target libmpv version ever changes, re-verify the struct layouts here.**
 * JNA reads these structs by raw offset — a field added, removed or reordered upstream is
 * silent memory corruption, not a clean link error. (The layouts happen to be byte-identical
 * between 0.37.0 and current master, but that is not a guarantee going forward.)
 *
 * ## Threading contract
 * From client.h: a single `mpv_handle` may be used from multiple threads, but [mpv_wait_event]
 * must only ever be called from ONE thread at a time. This project dedicates one pump thread
 * per handle (see [MpvPlayer]).

 *    at the same time, instead of appending them"*, and *"`!new_stream` must be the first

 * ytdl requirements"* and that both headers are *"not part of the core EDL format"* and *"may be
 * changed or removed at any time"*. Our entries are single whole-file URLs with no declared
